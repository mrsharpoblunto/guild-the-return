# Guild: The Return
Source code to my first attempt at building a game when I was 13 years old. For some background info on the game & why I still have the source code after all these years, check out https://sharpoblunto.com/News/2024/02/02/return-of-the-guild-returns.

To build & run this:
- Download and install [QB64-Pheonix-Edition](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe)
- Open main.bas from the QB64 IDE and select Run->Start.
